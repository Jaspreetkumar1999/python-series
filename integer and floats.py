# num =3.5
# print(type(num)) to see type of num
# print(3**2) to exponent powers  try also some other basics  +-/ // %
num = -1
# # num = num+1
# num +=1 to increment

# print(abs(num)) it will print absolute value means it will remove negative sign
# print(round(4.34)) to round of near by integer value
# for = 3
# print(for) varible name should be beyound the inbuilt func
# print(round(4.34,1)) passing position upto we want round off
# # print(3==2)
# # print(3!=2)
# # print(3>2)  these all will return output in the form of boolean values
# # print(3<2)
# # print(3>=2)
# print(3<=2)
num_1 = '100'
num_2='200'
# print(num_1+num_2) it will show only concatenation of strings
num_1 = int('100')
num_2= int('200')
# print(num_1+num_2) it will show arithmatic output
